An FPGA experiment with the Olimex iCE40HX1K
Based on a university assignment to program a PLD to run a small "fencing game."

I am using this guide https://github.com/plex1/raspice40 to set up my Pi3B+ to program the Olimex iCE40HX1K.

I am initially generating the necessary bin files with Lattice free proprietary software (iCEcube 2), but down the line I want to use a fully open source toolchain.
